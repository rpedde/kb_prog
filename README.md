So this is like via, only stupider and in python.

So VIA won't run on any of my linux machines, and when I look at the
github project for it, there doesn't seem to be any code in that code.
Or maybe javascript stuff just isn't recognizable to me as code.
Whatever.  In any case, in the spirit of NIH, I have made my own key
editor that's only just barely good enough to keep from from booting
up my wintendo machine (where via can run).

I'm fairly sure this won't work for you, but I won't stop you from
discovering this for yourself.  I wholeheartedly endorse the "running
at full tilt toward walls" school of learning.
